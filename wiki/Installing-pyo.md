# Installing `pyo` on Windows

`pyo` can only be installed for 32-bit python on Windows. To install `pyo` for 32-bit python on Windows, download the correct .exe installer from here: <http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/software/pyo/>. When you run the installer, you can select the python installation you want to be able to use `pyo`.

# Installing `pyo` on macOS

Installing `pyo` on macOS is a bit more difficult. Here's how to do it. Ideally, it would be possible to install pyo from a .dmg file from here: <http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/software/pyo/>. Unfortunately, this installs `pyo` for a Framework build of python. That is, the installer creates folders at "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework" even if no Framework build of python is installed, and therefore it doesn't work out of the box for a version of python installed with Homebrew, Anaconda, or Enthought Canopy.

You can still use the .dmg installer, but you have to manually move the `pyo` files from "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework" to your Anaconda python (e.g., at "/usr/local/anaconda3/"). Specifically you have to move the following files.

- \_pyo.so
- \_pyo64.so
- pyo.py
- pyo64.py
- pyolib (folder)

In addition to creating and compiling these files, the .dmg installer also creates the following dynamic libraries.

- liblo.7.dylib
- libportaudio.2.dylib
- libportmidi.dylib
- libsndfile.1.dylib
- libFLAC.8.dylib
- libvorbisenc.2.dylib
- libvorbis.0.dylib
- libogg.0.dylib

It puts these libraries in your "/usr/local/lib" directory.

If you use Homebrew, this is a problem, as `pyo` has now put things into folders managed by Homebrew that were not installed by Homebrew, and it might break other stuff. If you don't use Homebrew or some other system for managing what's in your /usr/local/lib, you may at some point install something that breaks `pyo`.

To compile `pyo` from source, you first have to install the .dylibs with Homebrew, and then install `pyo` from github.

```bash
brew install liblo libsndfile portaudio portmidi
```

Then you can install `pyo` from git.

```bash
pip install \
  --install-option="--use-coreaudio" \
  --install-option "--use-double" \
  git+git://github.com/belangeo/pyo.git
```

Assuming all goes well, you can now use `pyo` as your audio lib for psychopy.

```python
import pyo
```
