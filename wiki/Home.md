# Welcome to the wiki for setting up a computer for `psychopy` experiments!

If you are reading this page, it's likely you want to install the `psychopy` python package for running cognitive psychology experiments on your computer. `psychopy` has standalone installations available here: <http://psychopy.org/installation.html>; maybe you want to try that method first? If that method doesn't work for you, this wiki is for you.

To get started, you'll need to know some basic information about the computer you are trying to run `psychopy` on:

- Operating system: macOS (e.g., 10.12 aka Sierra), Windows version (e.g., Win10-64bit aka Windows 10 64-bit).
- Python installation: Basic installer from python.org, Anaconda installer, Enthought Canopy installer.

You also need to decide if you need the following features of `psychopy`:

- Playing audio files: requires `pyo` or `pygame`.
- Using an external device like an eyetracker: requires the additional requirements for running psychopy's `iohub` module.

**Note:** On Windows, `pyo` is only available for 32-bit python.
